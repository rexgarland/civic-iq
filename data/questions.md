# A jury can contradict previous law when making a verdict? #law 
- [x] Yes
- No
```
A jury can judge both the facts of a case and the law itself, even in contraduction to the judge. This is called jury nullification, and it's been a right in America since before the founding of the US. Recent examples include the acquittal of peace protestors who had clearly broken the law. Sounds simple in theory, but good luck trying it out in a modern courtroom; judges and prosecutors are less-than-keen about you knowing your rights, and will often pressure jurors to agree with the facts and laws as interpreted by the judge instead.[1]
