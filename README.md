# Civic IQ

A small quiz to test your knowledge of modern U.S. politics, aka participation in power. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

Code mostly forked from [8values](https://github.com/8values/8values.github.io), into the `website` folder. See `website/LICENSE`.

## Install

`yarn install`

## Run

`yarn start`

## How to add/edit a question

You can add more questions by simply editing `data/questions.md` and then running `yarn build` to render them into `website/questions.js`.

Here's a simple example:

```md
# How many people represent you in Congress?
- 1
- [x] 3
- 5
- 535
```

Check out that file for more examples. It's also good to include sources when appropriate.

Also, feel free to add work-in-progress there as well, since it won't be parsed.

## Writing questions

The intended purpose of this quiz is to get people more confident to participate in power (e.g. write their rep, make a FOIA request, attend a city hall, etc).

Note: we should be careful not to exclude any protected groups based on phrasing or choice of questions.
